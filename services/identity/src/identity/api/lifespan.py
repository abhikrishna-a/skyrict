"""Application lifespan - startup verification and graceful shutdown.

Extracted from main.py for testability and separation of concerns.

Startup: verifies every required dependency ONCE (database, Redis, JWT keys)
and refuses to boot on failure - the orchestrator sees the non-zero exit and
restarts the pod instead of serving traffic with a dead dependency. The
readiness gate only opens after verification succeeds; ``GET /ready`` reports
it (with lightweight live probes) but never re-runs this verification.

Shutdown: closes the gate so probes drain the pod, disposes the DB engine,
and closes the Redis pool.
