"""High-water-mark (HWM) semantics for incremental Bronze extraction.

All logic in this module is **pure** — no I/O, no connector, no engine — so the
incremental contract is *provable in CI* without any database. This honors the
repo's heritage rule that DB-gated tests skip when compose Postgres is
unavailable, while the pure carrier contract stays green everywhere.

Contract (what CI proves)
-------------------------
1. **Monotonic advance.** A watermark only moves *forward*. ``advance_watermark``
   returns the identity unless the candidate *strictly* exceeds the stored HWM,
   or — at an *equal* HWM — the candidate PK strictly exceeds the stored boundary
   PK. Re-running the same load is a no-op; the stored value never regresses.
2. **Exact incremental clause.** The predicate is

       (wm_col > :hwm) OR (wm_col = :hwm AND pk_col > :hwm_pk)

   Re-running with the *same* stored watermark re-fetches **exactly zero rows**
   (no duplicates, no gaps) — idempotent by construction.
3. **Parity-safe.** ``(wm_col, pk_col)`` is a strict total order, so a
   full → incremental transition can never double-count or skip a row.
